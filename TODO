Future enhancements to Fwctl
----------------------------
- Find a way to customize the install 
  to handle the sbin et config file installation.

- Automatic way to test the firewall. 

- Report generator on accounting and log. (Will probably be part
  of my SyslogScanner module)

- User space daemon to do IDS and stateful filtering
  using the fwmonitor device.

- Have a way to generate all the rules without setting them,
  to retreive the current settings and determine what need
  to be changed rather, than the actual tear down, rebuild.
