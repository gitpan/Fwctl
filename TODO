Future enhancements to Fwctl
----------------------------

- Add possibility to log only connection initialization packet.

- Add support for transparent proxy.

- Add a bidirectional option ?

- Redesign using a an abstract representation of rules and
  allow driver to generate rules for different packet filters
  (ipfwadm, ipchains, iptable, Cisco, etc.)

- Find a way to customize the install 
  to handle the sbin et config file installation.

- Automatic way to test the firewall. 

- User space daemon to do IDS and stateful filtering
  using the fwmonitor device.

  (This will probably wait for new netfilters module)

- Have a way to generate all the rules without setting them,
  to retrieve the current settings and determine what need
  to be changed rather, than the actual tear down, rebuild.
