# Aliases for fwctl
# 
# These names can be used instead of IP/Netmask pair in
# the rules files.
# 
# fwctl automatically creates the followiing aliases ses for each 
# interfaces defined in the file interfaces(5). 
# <NAME>_IF = the name of the interface
# <NAME>_IP = the IP of the interface
# <NAME>_NET= the network of the interface
# <NAME>_NETS= all the networks attached to the interface
#
# You can define others aliases here
# You guessed that comments starts by # and that
# blank lines are ignored ? Good for you.
# 
# Now alias are alphanumeric (underscore also allowed) and
# their expansion is separated by a = or :, whichever 
# you prefer. (You may also use := or =: if that please you.
# (or ======== for that matter)). As always TMTOWTDI!

# ROUTER	    = 
# NTP_SERVERS	    = 
# REMOTE_SUPPORT    =
