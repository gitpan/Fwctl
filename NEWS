Fwctl NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  23 Jan 2000

* Changes in fwctl 0.23

** New report generation tools.

    - fwctlog: Transforms kernel packet log messages into an intermediate
      format that can be used to generates report.
    - fwctlreport: Can generates 15 different reports with various parameters
      from the output of fwctlog.
    - fwctlacctlog: Generates report for accounting statistics dumped by the 
      fwctl dump-acct command.

   The example cron and logrotate configuration files uses those tools to 
   generate daily and weekly reports.

** Support for multiple interfaces with same IP.

   An interface can now be associated with an alias. You can tag
   hosts and networks expansion with the name of the interface in
   parentheses. This will override the default interface guessing mechanism.
   It is only useful when you have multiple interfaces with the same
   IP address (as occuring with IPSec). All default aliases are tagged
   with their respective interface.

   Example :

   VPN_CLIENT1 = 192.168.4.1(VPN1)
   
   
** Support for generic IP forwarding.

   It is now possible to generate rules for non tcp/udp << port >> 
   forwarding. You still have to start the ipfwd daemon separately. The
   PPTP and IPSec services takes advantage of this new features to
   support the --portfw option.

** Bug fixes:
	- Missing optional ipmasqadm triggered a configuration time error.
	- Allow device wildcards (ppp+) in interfaces configuration.
	- Masquerading of the ftp port data connection.

* Changes in fwctl 0.22

** Support for port forwarding with TCP and UDP based services. You can
   now use a --portfw [ip] option with most services to specify one of the
   firewall's ip address from which the service will be redirected to its
   destination. 

** New services: ip_pkt, udp_pkt, icmp_pkt, pptp and ipsec.

** Masquerading not limited to icmp, tcp, udp. (Useful on kernel
with VPN masquerading patch).

** Protocol can now be specified numerically.

** New alias: IF_REM_NETS expands to all networks attached to an
interface EXCEPT the directly connected one.

** fwctl flush will flush all chains even if there is a configuration error.

** Bug fixes: 
	- IF_NETS alias expansion. 
	- Forwarding between two networks attached to the same interface.
	- fwctl.init: check was doing a flush.
	- Output chains protocol  optimisation wasn't working. (All packets
	  passed through all the chains).

* Changes in fwctl 0.21

** Default directory for configuration files is now under /etc/fwctl

** Default accounting files is now named fwctl_acct.

** Fwctl now uses Net::IPv4Addr which was renamed from Network::IPv4Addr.

** Hylafax services now works correctly.

** Ping accounting doesn't fail. 

** New services : pcanywhere.pm, lpd.pm, redirect.pm.

** -log, -copy, -mark options now works as expected.

** debian packaging by Bernd Eckenfels <ecki@lina.inka.de>

** Added sample logrotate config file in RedHat package.

** New flush commands.

You can now reset the kernel packet filters by using the fwctl flush 
commands. It deletes flush all rules, deletes all chains and sets the
default policy to ACCEPT all.
