Fwctl NEWS -- History of User-Visible Changes. August 01 2000

* Changes in fwctl 0.28

* Now distributed under GPL only.

* New service definitions for Cytrix ICA (Fwctl::Services::ica).

* Bugs fixed:
    - Masquerading module wasn't loaded when port forwarding was turned on.
    - Requires Net::IPv4Addr 0.10 for security.

* Changes in fwctl 0.27

* Bug fixes:
    - Reduce memory usage by four for report's generation.
    - Interface selection was broken when multiple routes were possible. 
      (It picked the first one, rather than the most specific).
    - Fixed ordering problem in the all service related to rules 
      optimization.

* Changes in fwctl 0.25

** Configuration 
    - Possible to change the default policy using a new --default 
      command line option. (Use with care.) Defaults remains DENY.
    - Possibility to change the default logging policy with a new
      --log or --nolog command line option. Defaults remains --log.
    - Possibility to specify default marking and copy behaviour using
      the command line --mark and --copy. The defaults is now to copy
      unknown packets to user space. 

** Reports
    - Selection of subset of records is done via expression like tcpdump's
      rather than command line switch.

** Name service
    - When using the -server option, accepts queries from any ports rather
      than 53 and > 1023.

** Bug fixes:
    - Postrotate script definitions.
    - Src and dst ip when removing duplicates in reports wasn't done 
      properly.

* Changes in fwctl 0.24

** Miscellaneous enhancements:
    - Write NO RECORDS when no records are found in a report's period.
    - Use carp and croak only for programmer's errors.
    - Check for path of ipchains at startup.
    - Make sure that the logrotate script generates only a one week report.
 
** Bug fixes:
    - Error when Date::Manip module wasn't present.
    - For some reports, there was an error when no records we found for 
      the report's period.
    - When dumping accounting stats, there was a silent error when ipchains
      couldn't be found in the PATH.

* Changes in fwctl 0.23

** New report generation tools.

    - fwctlog: Transforms kernel packet log messages into an intermediate
      format which can be used to generate reports.
    - fwctlreport: Can generate 15 different reports with various parameters
      from the output of fwctlog.
    - fwctlacctlog: Generates report for accounting statistics dumped by the 
      fwctl dump-acct command.

   The example cron and logrotate configuration files uses those tools to 
   generate daily and weekly reports.

** Support for multiple interfaces with same IP.

   An interface can now be associated with an alias. You can tag
   hosts and networks expansion with the name of the interface in
   parenthesis. This will override the default interface guessing mechanism.
   It is only useful when you have multiple interfaces with the same
   IP address (as occurring with IPSec). All default aliases are tagged
   with their respective interface.

   Example:

   VPN_CLIENT1 = 192.168.4.1(VPN1)
   
   
** Support for generic IP forwarding.

   It is now possible to generate rules for non tcp/udp << port >> 
   forwarding. You still have to start the ipfwd daemon seperately. The
   PPTP and IPSec services take advantage of this new feature to
   support the --portfw option.

** Bug fixes:
	- Missing optional ipmasqadm triggered a configuration time error.
	- Allow device wildcards (ppp+) in interface configuration.
	- Masquerading of the ftp port data connection.

* Changes in fwctl 0.22

** Support for port forwarding with TCP and UDP based services. You can
   now use a --portfw [ip] option with most services to specify one of the
   firewall's ip address from which the service will be redirected to its
   destination. 

** New services: ip_pkt, udp_pkt, icmp_pkt, pptp and ipsec.

** Masquerading not limited to icmp, tcp, udp. (Useful on kernel
with VPN masquerading patch).

** Protocol can now be specified numerically.

** New alias: IF_REM_NETS expands to all networks attached to an
interface EXCEPT the directly connected one.

** fwctl flush will flush all chains even if there is a configuration error.

** Bug fixes: 
	- IF_NETS alias expansion. 
	- Forwarding between two networks attached to the same interface.
	- fwctl.init: check was doing a flush.
	- Output chains protocol  optimisation wasn't working. (All packets
	  passed through all the chains).

* Changes in fwctl 0.21

** Default directory for configuration files is now under /etc/fwctl

** Default accounting files is now named fwctl_acct.

** Fwctl now uses Net::IPv4Addr which was renamed from Network::IPv4Addr.

** Hylafax services now works correctly.

** Ping accounting doesn't fail. 

** New services : pcanywhere.pm, lpd.pm, redirect.pm.

** -log, -copy, -mark options now works as expected.

** debian packaging by Bernd Eckenfels <ecki@lina.inka.de>

** Added sample logrotate config file in RedHat package.

** New flush commands.

You can now reset the kernel packet filters by using the fwctl flush 
commands. It deletes flush all rules, deletes all chains and sets the
default policy to ACCEPT all.
