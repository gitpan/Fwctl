Fwctl NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.  17 Dec 1999

* Changes in fwctl 0.22

** Support for port forwarding with TCP and UDP based services. You can
   now use a --portfw [ip] option with most services to specify one of the
   firewall's ip address from which the service will be redirect to its
   destination. 

** New services: ip_pkt, udp_pkt, icmp_pkt, pptp and ipsec.

** Masquerading not limited to icmp, tcp, udp. (Useful on kernel
with VPN masquerading patch).

** Protocol can now be specified numerically.

** New alias: IF_REM_NETS expands to all networks attached to an
interface EXCEPT the directly connected one.

** fwctl flush will flush all chains even if there is a configuration error.

** Bug fixes: 
	- IF_NETS alias expansion. 
	- Forwarding between two networks attached to the same interface.
	- fwctl.init: check was doing a flush.
	- Output chains protocol  optimisation wasn't working. (All packets
	  passed through all the chains).
